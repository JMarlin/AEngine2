AENGINE2: A simple 2D point-and-click adventure game engine
------------------------------------------------------------

   AEngine2 encapsultes the core framework of a rudimentary point-and-click game
and, with recognition of the similarities in user interaction, was designed to
be a system familiar to web developers. To this end, development of an AEngine2
based game involves the creation of XML files defining the layout of objects for
each scene/level/room in the developer's game and containing scripting blocks
written in JavaScript which allow the implementation of interactive behaviours
thereof. 

   Each game should contain the following minimum directory structure:
   
    |
    |-- AEngine2.jar
	|
	|-- game
	|-- start.xml
	|-- global
		|
		|-- ui
		     |
		     |-- itemhighlight.png
		     |-- lookbutton.png
		     |-- looktool.png
		     |-- scrolldown.png
		     |-- scrollup.png
		     |-- toolstub.png
		     |-- ui.png
		     |-- usebutton.png
		     |-- usetool.png
		     |-- walkbutton.png
		     |-- walktool.png
				   
   start.xml is the first level definition loaded by the engine, analogous to
a website's index file while the images in the game\global\ui folder define the
UI skin for the game. Arbitrary structure may be appended to this basic tree
with the scripts in each level linking those resources together into a complete
game. 

   For scripting API reference, one may examine InterfaceTree.java. For a design
example, one may reference the Aaron and the Floating Shaman Head game sources
for which the engine was designed which can be found at
